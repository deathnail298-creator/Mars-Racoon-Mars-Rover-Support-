# Phase 2 — Completion Criteria (Theory-Only)

> **License Note**  
> Governed by **TEL-1.0 — Theory Exploration License**.  
> This document is conceptual only.  
> Nothing here authorizes fabrication, testing, simulation, manufacturing, commercialization, or operational execution.  
> Any execution requires a paid **Phase 3 Execution License**.

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

Phase 2 is not “hand-wavy confidence” or “we talked enough.”
Phase 2 has a job:

> Establish whether Mars Raccoon has a **credible**,
> **responsible**, **bounded**, and **explainable**
> path to execution — without actually executing.

This document defines the conditions required to honestly say:

**Phase 2 is complete.**

## 2. Philosophy of Completion

Phase 2 completion is not declared because:
- we like the concept  
- it feels exciting  
- it sounds fundable  
- stakeholders are smiling  

Phase 2 completion is declared only if:

- risks are named  
- limits are accepted  
- mitigations are logical  
- testing doctrine is sane  
- kill triggers exist  
- a responsible team could execute safely **if licensed**  

If any of those are missing, Phase 2 is *not* complete.

---

## 3. What Phase 2 Must Prove Conceptually

Phase 2 must demonstrate the following **on paper, in reasoning, and in disciplined framing**:

1️⃣ System Architecture is Credible  
2️⃣ Subsystems Are Defined and Bounded  
3️⃣ Prototype Pathways Make Sense Conceptually  
4️⃣ Testing Doctrine Is Honest and Safety-Dominant  
5️⃣ Risks Are Explicit, Not Minimized  
6️⃣ Constraints & Limits Are Accepted and Binding  
7️⃣ Honest Kill Doctrine Exists  
8️⃣ Execution Path Is Visible (If Licensed)

If even one of these is weak, Phase 2 is incomplete.

## 4. Completion Requirement Breakdown

---

### **CR1 — Architecture Coherence Confirmed**
Phase 2 is complete only if:

- System architecture is stable  
- Roles of major subsystems are clear  
- No hidden magical dependencies exist  
- Vault supremacy remains intact  
- Safety and predictability anchor everything  

If the architecture still feels like “we’ll figure it out later,”  
Phase 2 is not done.

---

### **CR2 — Subsystems & Interfaces Are Defined**
Completion requires:

- clear subsystem boundaries
- defined responsibilities
- defined interaction rules
- constraints baked in
- failure locality philosophy preserved

If subsystems blur or rely on luck,  
Phase 2 is not done.

---

### **CR3 — Prototype Pathways Are Realistic**
Conceptual prototype paths must:

- target hard problems early  
- avoid theater-testing mentality  
- separate subsystems cleanly  
- not assume infinite budget or patience  
- explicitly prioritize safety and vault protection  

If prototype thinking depends on “hero miracles,”  
Phase 2 is not done.

---

### **CR4 — Testing Doctrine Is Grounded and Failure-Focused**
Completion requires that conceptual testing:

- prioritizes discovering failure  
- respects Mars hostility  
- treats safety and predictability as dominant outcomes  
- explicitly tests failure behaviors, not just success cases  

If testing looks like marketing,  
Phase 2 is not done.

---

### **CR5 — Risks Are Documented Honestly**
Phase 2 is only complete if:

- High risks are openly acknowledged  
- Medium risks have real mitigation thinking  
- Low risks are tracked and not dismissed  
- No critical risk is minimized for comfort  

If the document set feels optimistic instead of disciplined,  
Phase 2 is not done.

---

### **CR6 — Constraints and Limits Are Owned, Not Avoided**
Completion requires:

- acceptance that Mars Raccoon cannot do everything  
- agreement that retrieval is probabilistic, not guaranteed  
- recognition that power is scarce  
- agreement that mobility is deliberately boring  
- understanding that autonomy must remain deterministic  

If someone is still secretly dreaming of a “hero robot,”  
Phase 2 is not done.

---

### **CR7 — Honest Kill Doctrine Exists and Is Respected**
Phase 2 only completes if:

- there are defined kill conditions  
- those kill conditions are meaningful  
- those kill conditions would actually stop the program  
- prestige, sunk cost, or optimism cannot override them  

If there is no responsible exit ramp,  
Phase 2 is not done.

---

### **CR8 — The Program Could Proceed Responsibly If Licensed**
This is the final sanity question:

If NASA or a contractor purchased a **Phase 3 Execution License**,  
does Phase 2 provide:

- a realistic execution direction?
- a clear set of engineering priorities?
- a disciplined set of safety principles?
- a bounded ambition profile?
- enough clarity to proceed without fantasy?

If the answer is **yes**, Phase 2 is complete.

If the answer is **“we’d be guessing”**,  
Phase 2 is not complete.

---

## 5. Phase 2 Completion Statement Template

Phase 2 should only be declared complete when the following statement is honestly true:

> “Mars Raccoon now has a disciplined, credible,
> bounded, and politically survivable execution path
> that a responsible organization could realistically pursue,
> provided they secure a Phase 3 Execution License.
> Risks are known, failure paths are safe, constraints are accepted,
> and success does not rely on miracle behavior.”

If that cannot be read aloud with integrity,
Phase 2 is incomplete.

---

## 6. Explicit Non-Execution Boundary

Completion of Phase 2 does **NOT** authorize:

- testing
- prototyping
- simulation
- manufacturing
- deployment
- commercialization

Phase 2 completion simply means:

**We are ready to proceed if legally and contractually authorized.**

Execution requires a paid **Phase 3 Execution License ($5,000)**.

---

## 7. Status

Phase 2 completion criteria: **defined**  
Decision discipline: **in place**  
Readiness to proceed (if licensed): **established conceptually**

Phase 2 framework is now fully constructed.
