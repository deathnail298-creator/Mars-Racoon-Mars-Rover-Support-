### Thermal & Survival Philosophy

This asset is expected to operate for weeks-to-months, not years. It is not a flagship rover and is not engineered to survive every seasonal extreme.

Thermal posture:
- Survival priority over comfort
- Minimize powered thermal management
- Leverage passive insulation and reasonable dormancy tolerance
- Accept that extreme environments shorten lifespan

Power posture:
- Low-duty cycle operation
- Planned long sleep intervals
- Accepts delayed mission timelines rather than oversized energy systems

This is a “good long while” asset, not a “live forever” asset. Mission value comes from opportunistic persistence, not guaranteed permanence.
