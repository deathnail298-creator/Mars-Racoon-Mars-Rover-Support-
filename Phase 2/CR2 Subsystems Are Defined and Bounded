### Tube Handling & Mechanical Interface Discipline

This system does not “generically grab cylinders.” It is explicitly designed around **Perseverance-class Mars Sample Tubes**, which are:
- precision scientific artifacts
- contamination-controlled
- seal-critical
- mechanically delicate relative to regolith hazards

**Architectural Requirements**
- Must secure tubes **without damaging external structure or seals**
- Must avoid generating dust ingress risk
- Must maintain readable identification and handling integrity
- Must avoid complex robotics wherever possible

**Conceptual Retrieval Approaches (Non-Execution)**
Multiple retrieval archetypes remain viable within Phase 2 theory:
- **Passive scoop + guided cradle funnel**
  - tolerant of dust
  - very few moving parts
  - uses geometry, not precision
- **Soft-grip saddle capture**
  - distributes pressure
  - avoids point loading
- **“bin and retain” interior vaulting**
  - once secured, tubes remain protected
  - reduces repeated manipulation risk

(We are explicitly *not* selecting a final mechanism in Phase 2. We are defining the operating envelope and failure boundaries.)

**Failure Locality Philosophy**
- A failed pickup should *only* be a failed pickup
- It must never compromise stored tubes
- It must never threaten the crawler’s survival
- It must not damage a NASA science asset

The handling system is therefore intentionally boring, heavily biasing toward passive geometry, dust tolerance, and failures that result in “try again later,” not catastrophe.
