## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines **how responsible engineering organizations would PROCEED** if execution were licensed — without actually executing.

This document exists to:

- clarify realistic development paths  
- prevent fantasy “hand‐wave to flight” thinking  
- help reviewers understand maturity sequencing  
- demonstrate that Mars Raccoon can evolve logically and safely  

This is NOT:

- a build script  
- a manufacturing plan  
- permission to do anything real

It is architecture discipline in planning form.

---

## 2. Phase 2 Development Philosophy

If execution were licensed, prototyping should proceed under three guiding truths:

1️⃣ **Start simple and brutal, not elegant**
- prove boring mechanics before refinement
- prove tube safety before mobility finesse
- prove retention before autonomy

2️⃣ **Test high-risk elements early**
- don’t hide weaknesses
- surface failure modes
- fix concepts before they fossilize

3️⃣ **Validate failure posture, not just success behavior**
- we care how it behaves when things go wrong
- “fails safely” is more important than “works beautifully”

Phase 2 is about honesty under pressure, not demonstrations for bragging rights.

---

## 3. Prototype Pathway Overview

If licensed, engineering execution would logically proceed in **four independent but converging prototype tracks**:

1️⃣ Retrieval Prototyping  
2️⃣ Vault Prototyping  
3️⃣ Power Endurance & Survival Prototyping  
4️⃣ Mobility & Stability Prototyping  

These tracks are **intentionally separable** to avoid dependency traps.
You do NOT need a full robot to validate the hard problems.

## 4. Retrieval Prototype Pathway (Conceptual)

### 4.1 Objective
Determine whether Mars Raccoon can retrieve tubes:

- gently  
- reliably  
- without precision robotics  
- while tolerating dust and misalignment  

---

### 4.2 Conceptual Prototype Strategy
If execution were licensed, practical retrieval prototyping would:

- begin with static bench setups
- test funnel geometries
- validate compliant capture approaches
- measure force thresholds for safe pull
- explore shallow burial tolerance
- validate “fail and walk away” thresholds

Retrieval development is a **geometry + mechanics** problem first, not a “robotics” problem.

---

### 4.3 Special Retrieval Testing Priorities
Conceptual priorities include:

- misalignment tolerance
- dust surface slickness + adhesion behavior
- unexpected snag resistance
- tube slippage behavior
- abort behavior reliability

If retrieval cannot meet acceptable safety behavior,
Mars Raccoon may still proceed as a **vault + consolidation** asset
but this document assumes retrieval will be pushed as far as honest engineering allows.

---

## 5. Vault Prototype Pathway (Conceptual)

### 5.1 Objective
Demonstrate that the vault:

- retains tubes reliably  
- protects tubes from impact and vibration  
- remains safe during shock or partial chassis failure  
- requires **no power** to remain secure  

Vault = core system value.
Vault must be validated with near-paranoid confidence.

---

### 5.2 Conceptual Prototype Strategy
If licensed, vault prototyping would:

- start as inert mechanical structures
- validate retention geometry
- test shock + vibration survivability
- test internal cushioning concepts
- test tube separation and collision prevention
- validate dust intrusion resilience at intake interface

Vault prototypes should intentionally receive abuse rather than admiration.

---

### 5.3 Special Vault Priorities
Key conceptual proof cases:

- retention under sudden impact  
- retention under inversion or tilt  
- internal organization integrity  
- intake sealing philosophy resilience  
- performance after simulated long-duration degradation  

Vault success is the most central Phase 2 goal conceptually.

---

## 6. Power Endurance & Survival Prototype Pathway (Conceptual)

### 6.1 Objective
Determine whether solar-driven power austerity can:

- support extended idle periods  
- support intermittent activity bursts  
- survive dust and winter realities  
- recover from deep power starvation  
- return safely to operation  

Power is not exciting — it is existential.

---

### 6.2 Conceptual Prototype Strategy
If licensed, responsible engineering testing would include:

- extremely low idle draw validation concepts  
- storage + recharge regime exploration  
- degraded-light endurance reasoning  
- long dormancy survival pathways  
- controlled reactivation behavior design  

RTG paths may be explored in theory but remain non-baseline.

---

### 6.3 Special Power Priorities
- true survival without daily sunshine
- predictable energy budgeting behavior
- no catastrophic power edge failures
- safe “I’m too weak” power handling philosophy

A Mars system doesn’t get to ask Mars for better weather.

---

## 7. Mobility & Stability Prototype Pathway (Conceptual)

### 7.1 Objective
Demonstrate that mobility can:

- traverse slowly and cautiously  
- avoid high-risk maneuvers  
- tolerate traction uncertainty  
- fail into **safe stability**, not chaos  

Mobility is a facilitator — not the mission.

---

### 7.2 Conceptual Prototype Strategy
If licensed, prototype work would likely include:

- local terrain simulation studies  
- traction & bogie / track stability reasoning  
- deliberate entrapment cases  
- deliberate tilt / slope constraint determination  
- stationary depot survivability evaluations

The goal is not acrobatics — it is boring competence.

---

### 7.3 Special Mobility Priorities
- stability envelope clarity  
- stuck behavior that remains predictable  
- never jeopardizing the vault  
- deliberate avoidance of “heroic” autonomy

If mobility dies but vault lives,
Mars Raccoon is *still successful*.

---

## 8. Integration Maturation (Conceptual)

Once independent conceptual prototypes demonstrate confidence in theory, responsible execution **would** proceed to:

- combine subsystems
- test transition behavior between modes
- characterize degraded states
- validate failure coherence

This should only occur after major risks are already reduced individually.
Integration should confirm maturity, not discover disasters.

---

## 9. Failure-Centric Demonstrations (Conceptual)

Phase 2 should **not** just show success cases.
Responsible engineering would focus heavily on conceptual failure proofing:

- retrieval jams
- partial burial failures
- vault partial shock failures
- mobility stall states
- comms outages
- power starvation
- compound stresses

The correct standard is:

> “Failure was boring, safe, and predictable.”

Not:
> “It worked beautifully when everything went great.”

## 🔴 10. Explicit Non-Execution Boundary

This document:

- does not authorize building  
- does not authorize testing  
- does not authorize prototyping  
- does not authorize simulation  
- does not authorize commercialization

It defines **how execution would proceed if licensed**, not that execution may begin.

Execution requires a paid **Phase 3 Execution License**.
