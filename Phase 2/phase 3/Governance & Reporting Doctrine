1️⃣ Governance Spine (Who Owns What)

Program Owner

Owns program accountability

Approves continuation or termination

Technical Authority

Owns architecture identity

Blocks complexity drift

Safety Authority

Owns mission risk posture

Has unilateral stop power

Execution Team Leads

Build the thing

Log reality

Do not spin results

No ambiguity. No shared ownership fog.

2️⃣ Required Governance Cadence
Routine Reporting

Minimum cadence:

Weekly during active development

Per-milestone during gated execution

Reports must include:

current status

failures encountered

deviations logged

risk posture snapshot

next actions

Deviation Reporting

Any meaningful deviation MUST:

be logged

be acknowledged

be reviewable

Silent deviation = governance breach.

Safety Posture Reviews

Conduct at:

Gate transitions

Major failures

Any condition change that alters risk

Safety Authority can:

freeze execution

demand review

halt indefinitely

No political override.

Gate Reviews

At each execution gate:

Formal review

Written decision

Signed approval or hold

Gate passing without documentation is invalid.

3️⃣ Governance Integrity Rules

No optimism masking reality

No redefining terms mid-execution

No “we’ll tidy documents later”

No leadership pretending ignorance

No PR narrative overriding technical truth

Governance exists to protect mission outcomes, not reputations.

4️⃣ Governance Failure Conditions

Governance is considered failed if:

decisions lack documented reasoning

results cannot be reconstructed

deviations are hidden

safety concerns are minimized

success is declared without proof

If governance fails:
Execution pauses.
Review is mandatory.

5️⃣ Governance End State

Governance must deliver:

a justified verdict

traceable logic

disciplined decisions

If the program ends and leadership cannot explain why, governance failed.
