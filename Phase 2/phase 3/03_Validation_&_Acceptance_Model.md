Phase 3 — Validation & Acceptance Model

Program: Mars Raccoon — Mars Rover Support / Sample Tube Retrieval Crawler

Phase 3 is not “vibes-based success.”
This document defines how Mars Raccoon is judged, what counts as validated, what counts as partial success with constraints, and what counts as failure. It prevents teams, managers, and politicians from redefining success halfway through execution.

If you are executing Phase-3 Mars Raccoon, this model is binding doctrine.

1️⃣ Purpose of This Model

This document ensures:

Phase-3 ends with a clear verdict

Success is measurable, not emotional

Failure is respected when it happens

“Close enough” is not quietly rebranded as success

Useful partial capability is acknowledged honestly

NASA-class drift, politics, and ego don’t rewrite reality

Phase-3 must answer one question:

“Is Mars Raccoon a viable, disciplined, mission-useful logistics crawler for Mars Sample Return support?”

2️⃣ Core Mission Definition (Ground Truth for Validation)

Mars Raccoon is:

A low-cost, boring, persistent Mars surface logistics crawler whose job is to retrieve dropped sample tubes and store them safely.

It is NOT:

a science rover

a mobility hero project

an experimental robotics showcase

a place to demonstrate clever autonomy tricks

Validation measures whether it does its one job reliably.

3️⃣ Validation Philosophy

Validation prioritizes:

Reliability over elegance

Repeatability over hero moments

Predictable behavior over intelligence gimmicks

Survivability over optimization

No one cares if it’s “impressive.”
They care whether it quietly does its job and doesn’t die.

4️⃣ Primary Validation Criteria

The system is validated only if it demonstrates the following with evidence:

A. Retrieval Reliability

Mars Raccoon must reliably pick up sample tubes under mission-plausible conditions.

Minimum required proof:

Successful retrieval of tubes across representative terrain conditions

Repeatable retrieval success, not a lucky one-off

Demonstrated ability to handle:

dust

temperature conditions

imperfect approach alignment

Objective:

“It can actually pick tubes up, repeatedly, without drama.”

B. Storage & Protection Integrity

Retrieved tubes must remain protected, secure, and mission-useful.

Proof requirements:

Secure vaulting or containment demonstrated

No damage to tube structures

Dust intrusion controlled

Retention under vibration / movement

Objective:

“Once Mars Raccoon has a tube, it stays safe, and it stays useful.”

C. Mobility Viability

Mars Raccoon must realistically move where it needs to go.

Proof requirements:

Mobility validated on Mars-analog terrain

Demonstrated ability to travel mission-relevant distances

Demonstrated ability to navigate at a simple, conservative complexity level

Failure behavior is predictable and survivable

Objective:

“It can get to tubes, not just in theory, but in practice.”

D. Operational Survivability

It must live long enough to matter.

Evidence:

Environmental survivability testing

Dust tolerance

Reasonable failure recovery posture

Honest understanding of what kills it

Objective:

“It survives long enough to be worth sending.”

E. System Simplicity Integrity

The architecture identity must remain intact.

Validation fails if:

It becomes a heroic science rover

It becomes complexity-poisoned

It deviates from the logistics-crawler identity

Objective:

“It is still Mars Raccoon, not a different program.”

5️⃣ Quantitative / Qualitative Balance

Mars programs do not live in clean laboratory graphs. Validation considers:

Repeatability

Reliability pattern trends

Operational practicality

Honest engineering truth

We do not allow:

marketing spin

cherry-picked runs

“hand-tuned demo passes”

political optimism masquerading as performance

6️⃣ Graded Outcome Model (Three Valid End States)

Phase-3 must end in one of these outcomes:

Outcome 1 — Validated

Mars Raccoon is validated if:

Retrieval works reliably

Storage protection works

Mobility is mission-credible

System identity is preserved

Failure behavior is understood

The team is not lying to themselves

Meaning:

This can realistically be pursued as a mission asset.

Outcome 2 — Constrained but Useful

Mars Raccoon is partially validated if:

It works, but within clearly defined limits

Constraints are real and documented, not hidden

It still provides meaningful mission value

Examples of acceptable constraint outcomes:

Works in certain terrain classes only

Works best as perimeter / zone retriever instead of full-range asset

Retrieval requires certain approach geometry

Lower endurance but still operationally meaningful

Meaning:

It’s not perfect, but it’s predictable and still valuable.

This is a legitimate win.

Outcome 3 — Clean Failure

Mars Raccoon is not validated if:

Retrieval cannot be made reliable

Mobility is fundamentally non-credible

Storage fails risk tube integrity

Survival probability is poor

Architecture identity collapses

Dishonesty or political distortion contaminates truth

Meaning:

Stop. Don’t pretend. Close out cleanly and move on.

Clean failure is honorable.
Lying failure is disgraceful.

7️⃣ Disallowed “Fake Success”

The following do not count as validation:

One lucky test success

Hand-placed ideal demo setups

“We think we can fix that later”

“Engineering confidence statements” with no data

PR-driven outcomes

Redefining success mid-execution

Calling partial function “operational”

Ignoring Mars realities

If Phase-3 tries to lawyer itself into victory, governance failed.

8️⃣ Evidence & Traceability Requirements

Validation decisions require:

Recorded testing

Documented results

Deviation logs

Honest failure records

Reproducible data

Authority-level review and sign-off

If reviewers cannot reconstruct:

what was tested

what happened

and why the verdict was reached

then validation is invalid.

Final Statement

Mars Raccoon Validation Model exists to ensure:

Truth

Discipline

Architectural integrity

Honest program decision making

Phase-3 ends with clarity:

It works

It works with constraints

Or it doesn’t
