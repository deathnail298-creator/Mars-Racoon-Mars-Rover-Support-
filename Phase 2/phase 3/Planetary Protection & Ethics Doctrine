Phase 3 — Planetary Protection & Ethics Doctrine

Program: Mars Raccoon — Mars Rover Support / Sample Tube Retrieval Crawler

Mars Raccoon exists in a planetary environment with scientific significance and legal/ethical constraints. This doctrine ensures Mars Raccoon behaves like a responsible mission citizen, not a careless piece of hardware.

This is not paperwork. This is discipline.

1️⃣ Ground Truth

Mars Raccoon:

operates on a world of high scientific value

handles scientific assets of exceptional importance

must not introduce reckless contamination risk

must not compromise future missions

Planetary protection is not about bureaucracy.
It’s about not screwing over science for the next 50 years.

2️⃣ Ethical Posture
Core Principles

Respect the environment

Respect science

Respect mission integrity

Avoid unnecessary harm

Do not trade ethics for convenience or PR

This program does not participate in:

reckless contamination

disregard for science zones

“we’ll deal with it later” thinking

3️⃣ Planetary Protection Boundaries

Mars Raccoon must be governed such that:

deployment zones respect contamination sensitivity

unnecessary surface disturbance is avoided

behavior remains predictable enough to stay within approved zones

late-life/post-failure states do not create new risk

If Mars Raccoon cannot operate responsibly, it should not operate.

4️⃣ Sample Stewardship Ethics

This system directly interacts with the most valuable objects on Mars: sample tubes intended for Earth return.

It must:

protect tubes over itself

avoid damaging samples

avoid behavior that risks scientific value

never use tubes as props for “testing”

If choice exists:

hardware dies

program ego dies

samples never get risked

5️⃣ Responsible Failure Posture

Failure does not excuse irresponsibility.

If Mars Raccoon degrades or fails:

stabilize

secure tubes

behave predictably

avoid uncontrolled movement

accept that sometimes “stop” is the ethical answer

Uncontrolled failing behavior is unethical mission behavior.

6️⃣ Deployment Ethics

Mars Raccoon should never be deployed:

into zones of high planetary protection sensitivity without necessity

to conduct tasks irrelevant to mission purpose

to run “because we have it” missions

Deployment must be justified by mission value, not curiosity or ego.

7️⃣ Human Accountability

Responsibility is not abstract.

Program Owner — signs ethical accountability

Technical Authority — ensures architecture supports ethical behavior

Safety Authority — ensures risk is not offloaded onto environment or science

No hiding behind “the system did it.”

8️⃣ Ethical Success Model

Planetary protection and ethical posture are successful when:

Mars environment is respected

scientific value is preserved

tubes are protected

failures do not become irresponsible events

nothing Mars Raccoon does forces future missions to fix its mess

If Mars Raccoon leaves Mars more complicated than it found it, ethics failed.
