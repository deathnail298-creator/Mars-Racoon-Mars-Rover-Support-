Phase 3 — Risk Posture & Failure Doctrine

Program: Mars Raccoon — Mars Rover Support / Sample Tube Retrieval Crawler

Mars Raccoon is a Mars surface logistics asset. That means risk posture cannot be hand-waved, romanticized, or pushed aside with optimism. This document defines:

how risk is viewed

what failure means

which risks are acceptable and which are not

how the program must behave when failure happens

If you are executing Phase 3, this doctrine is binding.

1️⃣ Reality Statement

Mars will kill weak systems.
It does not care about political optimism, contractor pride, or “we’ll improve it later.”

Mars Raccoon must be built with a clear, disciplined understanding that:

dust intrusion is relentless

thermal cycling destroys systems over time

comms latency prevents rescuing stupidity

mobility is unforgiving

everything that can fail eventually will

This doctrine exists so no one lies to themselves about that.

2️⃣ Risk Philosophy

Risk posture is simple:

We accept risk honestly

We control risk deliberately

We never hide risk

We never pretend risk disappeared because someone smiled in a meeting

Mars Raccoon is not risk-free.
It doesn’t need to be.
It needs to be predictable, bounded, and survivable enough to matter.

3️⃣ What Risks Are Acceptable

The program may accept:

engineering uncertainty as long as it is named

performance limits as long as they are explicitly documented

reduced capability that is still mission-useful

controlled subsystem failures that do not compromise retrieved samples

endurance limits that are honestly represented

graceful degradation rather than catastrophic failure

Acceptable risk means:

“We understand the risk, we can explain it, we can live with it, and it doesn’t undermine the core mission.”

4️⃣ What Risks Are NOT Acceptable

The following are non-negotiable no-go risks:

anything that materially endangers retrieved sample tubes

systemic dishonesty or omission about capability

architectural drift into complexity poisoning the system

dependency on “heroics,” luck, or technicians saving it in real time

designs that assume Mars will behave kindly

failure modes that are catastrophic rather than bounded

reliance on miracle software to fix bad hardware or architecture choices

political spin overriding technical truth

If any of the above are present and cannot be removed:

Mars Raccoon must not proceed.

5️⃣ Failure Philosophy

Failure is not shame.
Failure without discipline is shame.

Phase-3 failure doctrine:

Failure must be allowed to happen in test

Failure must be studied honestly

Failure must be documented without spin

Failure must inform decision making

Failure must not be buried to “protect momentum”

There are only two disgraceful outcomes:

lying about performance

pretending everything is fine

Everything else is legitimate engineering.

6️⃣ Required Failure Behaviors

Mars Raccoon must demonstrate:

Graceful Degradation

When it fails, it should:

fail in predictable patterns

not enter chaotic runaway behavior

not cascade into other subsystems

remain analyzable

Sample Protection Priority

If anything must be sacrificed:

Hardware dies first

Mission ambition dies second

Samples are protected last

The system must never:

crush

eject

expose

contaminate
retrieved tubes because it failed somewhere else.

Defined End-of-Life Logic

At failure or near-death states, Mars Raccoon must:

behave deterministically

preserve data

preserve tubes

stop trying to be a hero

No “thrashing behavior.”
No “endless panic mode.”
No gambling for miracles.

7️⃣ Failure Categories (Must Be Explicitly Characterized)

Phase-3 must explicitly classify failures into:

1️⃣ Benign Failures

Do not threaten mission value

Do not threaten stored tubes

Painful but survivable

2️⃣ Serious but Controllable Failures

Impact capability

Require honest admission

Require constraint framing

Still allow meaningful utility

3️⃣ Mission-Ending Failures

Undermine purpose

Threaten stored samples

Destroy credibility

Demonstrate system is not what it claims to be

Mission-ending failure requires clean termination.

8️⃣ Dishonesty Is a Hard Kill Condition

If any of the following occur:

hiding unsuccessful test runs

cherry-picking only “good demo footage”

redefining success mid-execution

presenting aspiration as data

strategic exaggeration of survivability

suppressing engineers raising real concerns

Then the program is to be considered:

Governance-failed, ethically compromised, and operationally invalid.

Phase-3 must stop.
Full review is required.
Trust must be rebuilt before execution resumes.

9️⃣ Authority and Risk Ownership

Risk ownership is not vague.

Program Owner

owns risk consequences

signs risk acceptance consciously

Technical Authority

owns system integrity risk

rejects complexity drift

has veto on architecture compromise

Safety Authority

owns human, mission, and planetary protection risk

has unilateral stop authority

Nobody hand-waves risk.
Nobody says “it’ll probably be fine.”

🔟 Clean End Rule (Risk Lens)

At the end of Phase-3, risk posture must enable a blunt statement:

“This system is credible and risk-responsible.”

“This system is useful but bounded; risk is manageable with constraints.”

“This system is not credible; risk overwhelms mission value.”

Anything more complicated than that is political fog.
