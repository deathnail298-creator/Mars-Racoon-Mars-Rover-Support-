Phase 3 — Ground Operations Interface Doctrine

Program: Mars Raccoon — Mars Rover Support / Sample Tube Retrieval Crawler

This doctrine defines how ground teams should interact with Mars Raccoon during real operations so it remains reliable, boring, and low-burden rather than becoming an operational headache.

If you’re planning, scheduling, or commanding Mars Raccoon, this doctrine is binding.

1️⃣ Ground Ops Identity

Mars Raccoon is infrastructure.

Ground teams must treat it as:

a persistent logistics asset

a quiet risk reducer

a predictable, low-drama system

If operators feel like they are “managing a problem child,” governance failed upstream.

2️⃣ Operator Philosophy

Mars Raccoon operations should be:

deliberate

conservative

predictable

low supervision

No frantic micromanagement. No heroism. No “let’s see what happens.”

3️⃣ Commanding Doctrine
Command Rhythm

Commands are periodic and purposeful, not constant.

Expected posture:

planned tasking

idle periods are normal

no compulsive “proof of life” gymnastics

Command Structure

Commands should:

have a clear mission purpose

be within envelope

end in a stable state

preserve reliability

Invalid commanding mindset:

experimentation for curiosity

show-off commands

gambling commands

4️⃣ Human / Machine Responsibility Boundary

Ground Teams Own:

task timing

operational zones

stop decisions

acceptance of deployment risk

EoL transitions

Mars Raccoon Owns:

conservative execution

predictable behavior

tube protection if carrying

graceful degradation

Neither side should pretend to be something it’s not.

5️⃣ Monitoring Doctrine

Monitoring posture should be:

aware

calm

non-obsessive

Watch for:

expected movement pattern

tube custody integrity

system health credibility

no thrashing/autonomy panic

If monitoring feels stressful → stop, reassess.

6️⃣ Restraint Doctrine

Ground will NOT:

push beyond envelope “to try”

risk tubes for ego

use Raccoon to rescue other programs

turn it into a rover proxy

run PR theater missions

If deployment feels heroic, it’s wrong.

7️⃣ Coordination Doctrine

Mars Raccoon must coexist cleanly with:

rovers

helicopters

other hardware

Principles:

never interfere with primary mission assets

keep coordination simple

remain subordinate in mission priority stack

If coordination burden rises, reduce use.

8️⃣ Ground Ops Success Model

Ground operations are successful when:

teams are calm

workload is low

Raccoon is predictable

risk goes down

logistics uncertainty decreases

nobody resents operating it

If operations are boring → success.

Final Statement

Mars Raccoon’s job is to quietly reduce mission risk, not introduce new operational stress.

Ground Ops success = calm, disciplined, predictable, boring reliability.
