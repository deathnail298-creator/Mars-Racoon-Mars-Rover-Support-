Phase 3 — Execution Checklist

Program: Mars Raccoon — Mars Rover Support / Sample Tube Retrieval Crawler

This checklist exists so Phase-3 execution cannot quietly drift, forget critical discipline, or claim “we thought that was implied.” If any box cannot be honestly checked, Phase-3 execution is not legitimate.

1️⃣ Preconditions (Before Phase-3 Starts)

☐ Valid Phase-3 Execution License in place
☐ Program Owner formally named
☐ Technical Authority formally named
☐ Safety Authority formally named (unilateral stop power acknowledged)
☐ Budget secured to reach Phase-3 verdict
☐ Phase-3 governance accepted as binding
☐ Traceability / logging structure active
☐ Kill-switch doctrine understood
☐ Phase-2 learnings acknowledged (if applicable)
☐ Architectural identity locked (logistics crawler, not rover-2.0)

2️⃣ Gate 1 — Ground Truth Alignment

☐ Mission role clarity documented
☐ Mobility envelope acknowledged
☐ Retrieval baseline confirmed
☐ Storage vault baseline confirmed
☐ Planetary protection posture acknowledged
☐ Environmental assumptions acknowledged
☐ Team agreement captured in writing
☐ Technical Authority signs

Gate Verdict:
☐ Pass ☐ Hold ☐ Redo

3️⃣ Gate 2 — Controlled Engineering Commitment

☐ Real design baseline exists
☐ Subsystem responsibilities locked
☐ Key risks explicitly documented
☐ Deviation logging confirmed active
☐ Traceability verified
☐ Technical Authority signs identity preserved

Gate Verdict:
☐ Pass ☐ Hold ☐ Redo

4️⃣ Gate 3 — Prototype Realization

☐ Physical machine exists
☐ Subsystems integrated
☐ Failure behaviors characterized honestly
☐ Safety posture validated
☐ Readiness state documented
☐ Safety Authority confirms acceptability

Gate Verdict:
☐ Pass ☐ Hold ☐ Redo

5️⃣ Gate 4 — Operational Proving

☐ Retrieval reliability proven (repeatable)
☐ Storage / protection credible
☐ Mobility mission-credible
☐ Survivability meaningful
☐ Evaluated against Validation & Acceptance Model
☐ Honest truth available for leadership

Gate Verdict:
☐ Validated ☐ Constrained-Valid ☐ Fail

6️⃣ Gate 5 — Program Decision

☐ Leadership verdict declared
☐ Documentation preserved
☐ Results archived
☐ Public / program narrative aligned to truth

End State:
☐ Scale Pursuit ☐ Constrained Utility ☐ Kill Cleanly

If any Gate is faked:

Phase-3 execution is invalid.
