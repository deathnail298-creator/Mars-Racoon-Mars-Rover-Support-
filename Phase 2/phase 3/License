# Phase 3 — License & Authority Definition

---

## 🔒 LOOK, DON’T TOUCH RULE (BLUNT VERSION)

You may **read**, **study**, and **analyze** Phase 2 and Phase 3 freely.

But the moment you:

* build
* prototype
* fabricate
* test
* simulate in operational context
* integrate into real systems
* deploy
* execute engineering work
* or otherwise **use** Mars Raccoon concepts beyond thinking and discussion

→ You must hold a valid **Phase 3 Execution License**.

No license = **no legal execution rights**.

Commercialization requires a separate future license beyond Phase 3.

---

## 1️⃣ Phase 2 Legal Boundary (Explicit)

All Phase 2 materials are governed by:

### **TEL-1.0 — Theory Exploration License**

Under TEL-1.0:

Phase 2 allows:

* reading
* thinking
* reasoning
* documentation
* conceptual planning

Phase 2 explicitly **prohibits**:

* fabrication
* hardware prototyping
* testing
* simulation execution
* manufacturing
* operational deployment
* commercialization

Phase 2 content exists for reasoning only.
It does **not** authorize real-world engineering activity.

Any execution requires Phase 3.

---

## 2️⃣ What Changes in Phase 3

Phase 3 introduces:

> **Execution Authority**

Phase 3 is the first point in the lifecycle where organizations are legally allowed to:

* build
* test
* simulate
* integrate
* perform engineering execution work

But only under the proper license.

---

## 3️⃣ Phase 3 Execution License

Execution rights are granted only through a:

### **Phase 3 Execution License — $5,000 (Required)**

> **Applies to BOTH Phase 2 and Phase 3 use.**
> If you apply, execute, prototype, simulate, integrate, or otherwise *use* anything derived from **Phase 2** or **Phase 3**, you must hold this paid **$5,000 Phase 3 Execution License**.
> Reading is free. **Using requires this license.**

This license grants legal permission to:

* construct hardware prototypes
* run laboratory or field test campaigns
* execute simulations
* perform system integration
* mature engineering designs
* generate performance data
* perform failure testing
* develop control software
* conduct Mars-analog operational testing

Execution = touching reality.

If an organization does not hold a Phase 3 Execution License,
they are **NOT authorized** to perform any execution activities, even if they possess the documents.

---

## 4️⃣ What Phase 3 DOES NOT Grant

Even with a Phase 3 Execution License, the following remain **NOT allowed**:

❌ commercial sales
❌ paid service deployment
❌ manufacturing for revenue
❌ proprietary exclusivity
❌ mission delivery as a paid product
❌ claiming ownership over Mars Raccoon IP

Phase 3 grants execution rights.
It does **not** grant commercial rights.

Commercial rights require a **separate future license**, outside the scope of Phase 3.

---

## 5️⃣ Responsibilities of Phase 3 License Holders

Anyone executing under Phase 3 must:

* honor all Phase 0 mission intent
* honor Phase 1 feasibility discipline
* honor Phase 2 constraints, limits, and kill doctrine
* follow Vault Supremacy doctrine
* maintain conservative behavior philosophy
* respect failure-safe doctrine
* avoid prestige creep and “hero robot” transformation
* document honestly
* terminate honestly if kill conditions are met

A Phase 3 License grants permission to execute,
**not permission to rewrite the program’s philosophy.**

---

## 6️⃣ Enforcement Reality

If an organization:

* executes without license
* commercializes without license
* or deliberately violates program discipline

They are:

* in breach of license
* not legally protected
* subject to legal action
* formally disassociated from Mars Raccoon lineage

This isn’t hostile.
It’s how serious engineering programs protect integrity.

## 7️⃣ Simple Summary

| Phase             | Legal State                | What You Can Do                    |
| ----------------- | -------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Phase 0–2         | TEL-1.0 Theory Only        | Think, plan, document conceptually |
| Phase 3           | Execution License Required | Build, test, simulate, integrate   |
| Commercialization | Phase 0 / Phase 1 License  | Sell, deploy, monetize             |

## Status

Phase 3 licensing and authority framework: **defined**
Legal boundary between Phase 2 / Phase 3: **clear**
Execution permission structure: **formalized**
