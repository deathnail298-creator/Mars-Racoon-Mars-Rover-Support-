### TRL Honesty Statement

Heritage exists for:
- Mars mobility
- power management approaches
- dust and environmental hardening
- surface navigation fundamentals

However, the *integrated* behavior has never flown:
- autonomous distributed retrieval
- crawl → locate → collect → vault loop
- ejection → righting → activation chain

Therefore:
- This concept is NOT “heritage proven”
- It is heritage-leveraged, but novel in composition

Raising TRL requires:
- analog field testing
- dust survivability studies
- retrieval loop performance validation

This is why Phase 2 remains theory-only and why Phase 3 is honestly required before anyone claims maturity.
