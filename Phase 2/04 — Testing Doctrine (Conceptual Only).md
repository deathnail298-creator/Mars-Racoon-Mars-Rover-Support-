## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines **how responsible organizations should think about testing Mars Raccoon**, *if* they were licensed to execute.

It establishes:

- what must be proven  
- how proof should be approached conceptually  
- what “success” and “failure” *mean* in testing philosophy  
- how to prioritize testing focus  

Phase 2 testing doctrine is about **discipline and truth**, not optimism or performance theater.

---

## 2. Core Testing Principles

Any responsible execution program should follow four doctrinal rules:

---

### **Principle 1 — Proof by Reality, Not Demonstration Theater**
Testing exists to discover failure, not to impress reviewers.

- if a weakness exists, find it
- if performance is marginal, admit it
- if something fails, document and learn
- no “PR demo thinking”

Testing is for engineers, not marketing.

---

### **Principle 2 — Test the Hard Things Early**
Do not validate easy wins first.

Priority testing order should be:

1️⃣ hardest and most mission-critical elements  
2️⃣ physically risky or safety-dependent behavior  
3️⃣ supporting systems  
4️⃣ cosmetic / optimization concerns only after success

If something is likely to hurt the mission, it must be confronted immediately.

---

### **Principle 3 — Failure Outcomes Matter More Than Success Outcomes**
The mission value of Mars Raccoon depends heavily on how it behaves when stressed.

Therefore testing must ask:
- does it fail gracefully?
- does it stay predictable?
- does the vault remain safe?
- does the system stabilize instead of escalating?

“Works when nothing goes wrong” is not a meaningful test.

---

### **Principle 4 — Test Independence**
Subsystems must be validated independently where possible.

- Vault can be proven without a driving platform
- Retrieval can be proven without a rover
- Power austerity can be proven standalone
- Mobility can be proven without full avionics maturity

Integrated system testing is not step one.
Integration should only confirm what is already believed, not discover foundations.

---

## 3. What Must Be Proven Conceptually

Testing (if licensed) must prove five things:

- Retrieval behaves safely and predictably
- Vault protects tubes reliably
- Power strategy supports mission timelines
- Mobility remains conservative and stable
- Failure posture truly prevents escalation

If these cannot be proven, Mars Raccoon does not deserve to exist.

---

## 4. Retrieval Testing Doctrine (Conceptual)

### **Core Testing Intent**
Responsible testing must verify that retrieval:

- protects tubes above mission pride
- tolerates misalignment
- handles dust and rough contact geometry
- avoids dangerous force application
- defines and respects “walk away” rules

---

### **Conceptual Retrieval Test Themes**
If licensed, retrieval testing should conceptually include:

- alignment tolerance trials
- compliant element behavior
- shallow burial tolerance
- slippage scenarios
- jam scenarios
- abort confidence

---

### **Retrieval Test Success Philosophy**
Retrieval should be considered successful if:

- retrieval works reliably in “normal ugly Mars conditions”
- when it fails, it fails safely
- tube risk remains low
- mechanism is simple and robust, not clever and fragile

Success condition is **not “perfect capture every time.”**  
Success condition is **“safe, useful, honest performance.”**

---

## 5. Vault Testing Doctrine (Conceptual)

### **Core Testing Intent**
Prove vault integrity beyond reasonable doubt.

The vault is the **center of mission value**.

---

### **Conceptual Vault Test Themes**
If licensed, responsible vault testing would focus on:

- shock & vibration retention
- internal collision prevention
- dust barrier behavior
- intake interface durability
- partial structural compromise resilience
- long-duration degradation effects

Vault testing should seek to **hurt the vault** and ensure it does not fail catastrophically.

---

### **Vault Test Success Philosophy**
Vault testing is successful when:

- tubes remain retained across abuse
- failure never equals free-floating samples
- power-off state remains safe
- structural insult does not equal mission loss
- vault behaves predictably

If vault cannot pass confidence standards → program dies honestly.

---

## 6. Power Testing Doctrine (Conceptual)

### **Core Testing Intent**
Prove power austerity is realistic.

- long idle life
- slow recharge reality
- degraded sunlight response
- dormancy → recovery stability
- energy budget honesty

Mars Raccoon is slow logistics infrastructure.
Power testing must treat power as scarce, not convenient.

---

### **Conceptual Power Test Themes**
If licensed, responsible programs should examine:

- low idle consumption regimes
- long duration endurance
- worst-case environmental profiles
- simulated dormancy cycling
- behavioral control under starvation

Power testing must be brutal, not gentle.

---

### **Power Test Success Philosophy**
Power testing is successful if:

- idle survival works realistically
- operational bursts are supported without panic
- degraded environments do not instantly kill the system
- starvation modes remain safe and recoverable

If solar cannot credibly support survival and operations,
a serious RTG conversation would occur — but NOT assumed baseline.

---

## 7. Mobility Testing Doctrine (Conceptual)

### **Core Testing Intent**
Prove Mars Raccoon does not:

- topple impulsively  
- dig itself into disaster  
- behave aggressively  
- surprise the mission  

Mobility competence > mobility performance.

---

### **Conceptual Mobility Test Themes**
If licensed, responsible testing would include:

- traction envelope characterization
- controlled slope capability
- deliberate entrapment outcomes
- stalled stability testing
- failure-safe stop behavior

We do not care about speed.
We care about safety and predictability.

---

### **Mobility Test Success Philosophy**
Mobility testing is successful if:

- mobility works safely
- failures are boring and safe
- vault remains protected regardless of terrain behavior

If mobility dies but vault stays safe, the system still has purpose.

---

## 8. Integrated Behavior Testing Doctrine (Conceptual)

Integration is **not** where Prototypes discover who they are.
Integration is where they prove what they already are.

Conceptually, integration testing must:

- validate transitions between states (idle → retrieval → idle)
- validate fault handling hierarchy
- validate compound fault behaviors
- ensure subsystems don’t create cascading failures

Integrated testing is about **coherence**, not heroics.

---

## 9. Failure Testing Doctrine (Conceptual)

Failure testing should be a deliberate, thoughtful discipline.

Responsible execution would test:

- retrieval jam + power limitation
- mobility stall + communication delay
- vault partial intrusion + thermal stress
- starvation + delayed recovery
- missing commands for long periods

The bar is simple:

> “Did the system stay safe, predictable, and valuable?”

If yes → acceptable.  
If no → redesign.

---

## 🔴 10. Explicit Non-Execution Boundary

This document:

- does **NOT** authorize testing  
- does **NOT** authorize prototyping  
- does **NOT** authorize simulation  
- does **NOT** authorize execution of ANY kind  

It outlines responsible thinking for testing **ONLY IF** execution is legally licensed.

Execution requires a paid **Phase 3 Execution License**.

Discipline: **established**
