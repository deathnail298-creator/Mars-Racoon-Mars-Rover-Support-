# Phase 2 — Engineering & Prototype Maturation (Theory-Only)

## License & Execution Boundary (READ THIS FIRST)

All Phase 2 content is governed by the **TEL-1.0 — Theory Exploration License**.

- Phase 2 material is **reasoning only**
- Phase 2 material is **NOT authorization to build, fabricate, test, or execute**
- Phase 2 does **NOT** grant any development or deployment rights
- **Execution, prototyping, manufacturing, simulation, testing, or operational use require a separate paid Phase 3 Execution License**

Phase 2 exists to explore feasibility, develop disciplined thinking, and document engineering logic — **not to perform work.**

If you want to *do* anything described here in the real world, you must secure a Phase 3 execution license first. No exceptions.

## Purpose of Phase 2

Phase 1 answered:
> “Is Mars Raccoon worth pursuing?”

Phase 2 exists to answer:
> **“If someone chooses to execute this system in the future, what would it realistically take to make it credible?”**

Phase 2 is:
- architecture definition
- reasoning-based engineering maturation
- conceptual prototyping pathways
- failure realism exploration
- constraint discipline

Phase 2 is *not*:
- a build instruction
- a manufacturing plan
- a green-light
- a field deployment authorization
- permission to execute

Nothing in Phase 2 should be interpreted as permission to do real work.

---

## Phase 2 Objectives

Phase 2 has four legitimate theory-only objectives:

1️⃣ Define realistic architectures  
2️⃣ Describe credible prototype and validation pathways  
3️⃣ Identify limits, constraints, and risks honestly  
4️⃣ Provide the thinking foundation necessary for Phase 3 decision making

At Phase 2 completion, a responsible reviewer should be able to say:

> “If this were executed under license, I understand what we’d need to build, why, where the risks are, and what needs to be proven.”

But again — Phase 2 is **thinking only**.

---

## Core Engineering Focus Areas (Reasoning-Only)

These are conceptual development domains, not execution mandates.

---

### 1️⃣ Retrieval System (Theory Planning)

Phase 2 must *theoretically* define how retrieval would plausibly succeed, including:

- alignment tolerance philosophy
- burial constraint policy
- compliant vs rigid capture logic
- safe abort thinking
- tube protection primacy

Execution of any retrieval system must not occur without Phase 3 licensing.

---

### 2️⃣ Storage Vault (Theory Planning)

Vault remains the core protective element.
Phase 2 defines the *theoretical engineering envelope* for:

- shock / vibration considerations
- dust intrusion mitigation strategies
- passive retention philosophy
- thermal cycling implications
- safe-when-dead doctrine

Actual vault testing or fabrication requires Phase 3 license.

---

### 3️⃣ Power Architecture (Theory Planning)

Phase 2 explores:
- solar endurance feasibility
- idle austerity doctrine
- storm survival reasoning
- recovery logic after dormancy

This is analytical and conceptual only.
Any real system testing or implementation requires Phase 3 licensing.

---

### 4️⃣ Mobility & Stability (Theory Planning)

Phase 2 reasoning validates:

- “boring mobility” operating philosophy
- entrapment tolerance doctrine
- stability envelope expectations
- intentional fail-safe bias

No rover, prototype chassis, mobility hardware, or field testing is authorized under Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2 Test Philosophy (Conceptual Only)

Phase 2 describes how responsible testing **would** be conducted *if* a licensed execution entity proceeded.

It emphasizes:
- marginal case design philosophy
- failure truth over performance pride
- political and mission reliability realities

Phase 2 does not authorize or conduct tests.
It only defines how they should be thought about.

---

## Phase 2 Deliverables (Non-Executable)

Phase 2 produces:
- reasoning documents
- architectural thinking
- conceptual prototype pathways
- analytical intent
- constraints and kill logic

Phase 2 does **NOT** authorize:
- hardware builds
- laboratory testing
- field trials
- simulation campaigns
- manufacturing
- integration
- operational use

Any attempt to do so without a Phase 3 Execution License is a license violation.

---

## Integration & Operations Reality

Phase 2 maintains the core intent:

Mars Raccoon is a **mission assurance asset**, not a hero platform.

But that statement remains conceptual only until formally executed.

Phase 2 discusses integration logic.
Phase 3 governs execution.

---

## Honest Kill Criteria (Still Apply Conceptually)

Mars Raccoon should be killed at Phase 3 execution planning if reality proves:

❌ Retrieval meaningfully risks tubes  
❌ Vault cannot be made truly safe  
❌ Power reality collapses without RTG and RTG is rejected  
❌ Failure unpredictability creeps in  
❌ Ops burden outweighs value  

Phase 2 preserves the honesty discipline,
even as a theory-only stage.

---

## Expected Phase 2 Outcome

If Phase 2 succeeds (theory-only success), we achieve:

- credible architecture understanding  
- realistic constraints  
- sober expectations  
- no fantasy engineering  
- clean Phase 3 readiness  

Phase 2 success does NOT mean authorization to build.

It means:
> “Execution is worth serious consideration under license.”

---

## Phase 2 Completion Definition

Phase 2 is complete when:

- architectures are logically defined
- credibility risks are understood
- constraints are explicit
- failure logic is mature
- documentation is honest and conservative

Then — and only then — Phase 3 (Execution License & Implementation Doctrine) becomes relevant.

---

## Status

Phase 2 planning framework established.  
Execution remains explicitly prohibited without a Phase 3 Execution License.
