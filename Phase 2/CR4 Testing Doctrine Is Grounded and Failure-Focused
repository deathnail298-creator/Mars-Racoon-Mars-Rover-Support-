### Earth Analog Testing Pathways (Conceptual Only)

Phase 2 forbids execution, fabrication, and simulation. However, any credible pathway beyond theory must demonstrate that **testing environments exist**, and failure discovery has somewhere real to happen.

If this proceeds to Phase 3, meaningful testing environments already exist:

**Mars Terrain Analogs**
- JPL Mars Yard equivalents
- Rover mobility proving grounds
- Controlled slope/obstacle fields
Purpose: traversal limits, mobility failure mapping, stuck-state behavior.

**Dust / Abrasion / Ingress**
- Fine-grain basaltic Mars soil simulant chambers
- Purpose: seal resilience, mechanical fouling tolerance, long-term dust loading behavior
- Explicit goal: find where dust kills us early, not late.

**Environmental Stress**
- Thermal cycling chambers
- Temperature endurance without excessive complexity
- Low-duty operational survivability

**Operational Use-Case Simulation**
- Clustered retrieval operation simulations
- Edge cases: tube occlusion, partial burial, misalignment, degraded terrain

### Link to Honest Kill Doctrine
Any of these could justifiably terminate the system early if it fails in ways that violate:
- survivability without heroics
- failure locality
- dust reality compliance
- “boring, persistent infrastructure” philosophy

In other words, analog testing exists not to prove success—it exists to give the program permission to terminate honestly if the Mars environment reality rejects the concept.
