# Phase 2 — Honest Kill Doctrine (Theory-Only)

> **License Note**  
> Governed by **TEL-1.0 — Theory Exploration License**.  
> This document is conceptual only.  
> Nothing here authorizes fabrication, testing, simulation, manufacturing, commercialization, or operational execution.  
> Any execution requires a paid **Phase 3 Execution License**.

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document defines **when Mars Raccoon deserves to die.**

A responsible program does not simply “hope it works.”
A responsible program defines:

- hard failure boundaries  
- what cannot be negotiated or excused  
- what realities cannot be spun politically  
- when integrity requires termination  

If you cannot name the “kill zones,”  
you are not running an honest engineering effort.

---

## 2. Philosophy of Honest Termination

The Mars Raccoon program adheres to four truths:

1️⃣ **Better to stop early than fail expensively later.**  
2️⃣ **A dead, honest program is success.**  
3️⃣ **If reality wins, acknowledge it.**  
4️⃣ **Never push a weak architecture into flight.**

This doctrine exists to **protect Mars Sample Return**, not pride.

---

## 3. Categories of Kill Triggers

Kill triggers fall into six domains:

1️⃣ Retrieval Kill Conditions  
2️⃣ Vault Kill Conditions  
3️⃣ Power / Endurance Kill Conditions  
4️⃣ Mobility / Stability Kill Conditions  
5️⃣ System Behavior & Predictability Kill Conditions  
6️⃣ Political / Programmatic Kill Conditions  

Each domain defines conditions that, if proven real in execution,
should stop the program cleanly and honorably.

---

## 4. Retrieval Kill Conditions

Mars Raccoon exists to help, not to endanger the sample mission.

### **Kill Condition R1 — Retrieval Consistently Threatens Samples**
If data shows retrieval:

- damages tubes  
- introduces unacceptable structural risk  
- meaningfully increases failure likelihood

→ **Program should stop.**

No amount of “maybe it improves later” excuses this.

---

### **Kill Condition R2 — Retrieval Reliability Is Fundamentally Weak**
If retrieval can only succeed in narrow, unrealistic cases  
and cannot be engineered safer or broader without violating system philosophy:

→ **Program should stop.**

Mars Raccoon is not allowed to become a fragile robotics stunt.

---

## 5. Vault Kill Conditions

The vault is sacred.
If we cannot make it safe, we walk away.

### **Kill Condition V1 — Vault Cannot Guarantee Retention Under Reasonable Stress**
If vault testing (conceptually, in an execution world) reveals:

- realistic shock cases eject tubes  
- interior collisions create credible risk  
- retention depends on power to remain safe  
- integrity collapses under plausible mission insult

→ **Program should stop.**

Vault supremacy is not negotiable.

---

### **Kill Condition V2 — Vault Integrity Requires High Complexity**
If vault safety requires:

- overly fragile mechanisms  
- constant active management  
- precise tolerances unsuited to Mars

→ **Program should stop.**

If safety requires magic, it isn’t safe.

---

## 6. Power & Endurance Kill Conditions

Mars does not care about our optimism.
If energy reality defeats Mars Raccoon, we must accept it.

### **Kill Condition P1 — Solar Endurance Is Unrealistic**
If credible analysis and early execution data indicate:

- power draw cannot be reduced sufficiently  
- dormancy / restart cannot be made stable  
- dust + winter reality make survival improbable

→ **Program pauses pending RTG strategy review.**
If RTG rejected → **Program dies honestly.**

---

### **Kill Condition P2 — Power Failure Endangers Vault**
If at any point vault safety depends on power:

→ **Immediate kill.**

Power loss must never equal tube risk.

---

## 7. Mobility & Stability Kill Conditions

Mars Raccoon does not get to be reckless.

### **Kill Condition M1 — Tip-Over Risk Cannot Be Reduced**
If realistic terrain analysis or testing indicates:

- tipping probability remains uncomfortably high  
- mitigation requires heroic redesign  
- vault safety under tip cannot be guaranteed

→ **Program should stop.**

---

### **Kill Condition M2 — Mobility Is Fundamentally Fragile**
If mobility requires:

- continual high-finesse autonomy  
- aggressive traversal mentality  
- unrealistic terrain optimism

→ **Program should stop.**

Mars Raccoon must not be a rover pretending not to be one.

---

## 8. System Behavior & Predictability Kill Conditions

A system that cannot be trusted is worse than useless.

### **Kill Condition S1 — Behavior Is Not Deterministic**
If:

- behavior is chaotic
- outcomes are unpredictable
- safety hierarchy fails to be explainable
- “it normally works” replaces engineering confidence

→ **Program should stop.**

---

### **Kill Condition S2 — “Heroic Autonomy” Becomes Required**
If Mars Raccoon evolution trends toward:

- highly experimental autonomy
- complex dynamic AI behavior
- logic that cannot be mission-board explainable

→ **Program should stop.**

Mars Raccoon must stay boring.

---

## 9. Political & Programmatic Kill Conditions

This matters because NASA is human.

### **Kill Condition O1 — Mars Raccoon Becomes a Prestige Threat**
If Raccoon is perceived as:

- politically threatening to primary mission assets  
- absorbing too much spotlight  
- complicating stakeholder narratives  

→ **Program should stop or retreat in ambition.**

Mars Raccoon wins by being supportive and quiet.
If it stops being that, it loses its adoption shield.

---

### **Kill Condition O2 — Costs Drift Toward Hero Platform**
If Mars Raccoon:

- creeps toward rover-class budgets  
- requires heroic infrastructure  
- becomes expensive drama instead of cheap insurance

→ **Program should stop.**

The value proposition collapses if Raccoon stops being affordable and boring.

---

## 10. Doctrine of Graceful Exit

If kill conditions are met:

- terminate cleanly  
- publish findings honestly  
- preserve lessons learned  
- acknowledge that disciplined termination is success  

The correct narrative is:

> “The architecture was tested honestly.  
> Reality spoke.  
> The program behaved responsibly.”

That earns credibility, not shame.

---

## 11. Final Rule

If at any point Mars Raccoon stops being:

- safe  
- predictable  
- simple  
- boring  
- support infrastructure  

Then Mars Raccoon has violated its purpose,
and the program should end.

---

## 12. Status

Kill doctrine defined.  
Integrity principle preserved.  
Program discipline reinforced.
