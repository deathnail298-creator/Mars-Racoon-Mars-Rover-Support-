# TEL-1.0 — Theory Exploration License  
**Applies to: /Theory, Phase 2 Materials, and Other Explicitly Marked Non-Executable Content**

---

## 1️⃣ Purpose of This License

This license exists to make the material in this repository **freely available for reading, thinking, academic discussion, and conceptual exploration**, while explicitly prohibiting unlicensed execution, prototyping, testing, commercialization, or operational deployment.

This content is **not open-source execution material**.  
It is **theory**, not authorization.

---

## 2️⃣ What You Are Allowed To Do (For Free)

Under TEL-1.0, you are freely permitted to:

- Read the material  
- Share the material unmodified  
- Discuss and analyze it  
- Teach it  
- Reference it in academic work  
- Think about it in any way you like  

No fees. No paperwork. No problem.

This license is intentionally generous for thought.

---

## 3️⃣ What You Are **NOT** Allowed To Do Without a Paid License

You may **NOT** do any of the following without a paid execution license:

- build anything described here  
- fabricate prototypes  
- simulate or test as part of an engineering program  
- incorporate any part of this concept into a real-world project  
- integrate into a mission  
- commercialize  
- sell services based on execution of this material  
- include it in proposals or bids as a deliverable capability  
- deploy operationally in any form  

In short:

> **If you want to *do* it, not just think about it, you must pay for execution rights.**

This protects the author’s ownership while allowing broad conceptual access.

---

## 4️⃣ Execution License Requirement

To legally execute anything derived from or materially influenced by this work, you must secure a **paid Execution License**.

### Baseline Execution License Fee
Unless otherwise stated, the default execution license fee is:

> **$5,000 (USD)**

This grants rights to:
- build  
- test  
- prototype  
- simulate  
- incorporate into proposals  
- develop commercially  
- deploy  
- operate  

Additional commercial licensing terms, higher-tier licenses, exclusivity arrangements, and institutional contracts may apply depending on use case and scope.

Execution licensing is handled directly with the project owner.

---

## 5️⃣ Phase 2 / Theory Boundary Clarification

Phase 2 material and all `/Theory` content:

- **does not authorize execution**
- **does not authorize prototyping**
- **does not authorize testing**
- **does not authorize manufacturing**
- **does not authorize real-world use**

Phase 2 is **thinking only**, not permission.

Phase 3 (or a separately negotiated execution agreement) controls execution.

---

## 6️⃣ Derivative Works Rule

You **may not** circumvent this license by:

- re-wording concepts
- re-packaging ideas
- “inspired by” execution
- partial implementation of unique architecture
- claiming “independent discovery” after exposure

If the work materially derives from this project’s ideas, structure, design logic, or system intent, it remains covered.

If you discovered the same idea independently **without exposure to this material**, that is your own work — but exposure establishes derivation.

---

## 7️⃣ No Warranty / Not Flight or Safety Certified

This material is:

- conceptual
- incomplete by design
- not validated
- not guaranteed correct
- not certified for aerospace, defense, medical, or industrial use

Use at your own risk, including conceptual influence.

No warranty is expressed or implied.

---

## 8️⃣ Enforcement

Unauthorized execution constitutes:

- license violation  
- intellectual property misuse  
- legal breach  

The owner reserves the right to pursue civil and contractual remedies.

The license is intentionally simple:
- Free to think.
- Pay to build.

---

## 9️⃣ Acceptance

By accessing, reading, or using this repository, you agree to the terms of TEL-1.0.

If you disagree, stop reading and do not use this material.

---

## 🔚 Summary in Plain English

- Thinking = Free  
- Talking = Free  
- Sharing = Usually Fine  
- Building = **Not Free**  
- Testing = **Not Free**  
- Commercializing = **Definitely Not Free**

If you want to execute:
> Get an execution license. Everyone wins.
