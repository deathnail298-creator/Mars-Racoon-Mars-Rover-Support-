## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document states **what Mars Raccoon is NOT allowed to be**, and what it realistically **cannot do**.

This prevents:
- fantasy capability creep  
- optimistic misrepresentation  
- slow drift from original mission purpose  
- false expectations from reviewers or stakeholders  

A mature system admits limits early.  
If limits are embarrassing, the system is not ready.

---

## 2. Philosophy of Constraints

Mars Raccoon follows three truth rules:

1️⃣ Constraints are not weaknesses — they are honesty.  
2️⃣ Limits protect design discipline.  
3️⃣ Every constraint exists to preserve mission credibility and vault safety.

---

## 3. Mission Boundaries

Mars Raccoon is:

- a **logistics** asset  
- a **probability booster**  
- a **risk reducer**  
- a **boring, dependable support infrastructure element**

Mars Raccoon is **not**:

- a primary science platform  
- a high-precision robotics demonstrator  
- a miracle retrieval robot  
- a dynamic exploration rover

If someone tries to make it those things, they are wrong.

---

## 4. Capability Limits (Hard)

These are **non-negotiable capability ceilings**.

---

### **C1 — Retrieval Is Not Guaranteed**

Mars Raccoon:
- cannot guarantee retrieval of every tube  
- cannot reliably recover deeply buried tubes  
- cannot promise performance beyond honest margins

If a tube is unsafe to retrieve, **Mars Raccoon must walk away**.

This is a feature, not a flaw.

---

### **C2 — Mobility Is Intentional, Slow, and Conservative**

Mars Raccoon:
- is not a rover analog  
- should not traverse aggressively  
- should not operate on dangerous slopes  
- should not attempt heroic terrain navigation

Mobility exists to **relocate**, not to explore.

---

### **C3 — Power Is Scarce**

System must assume:
- long idle periods  
- slow recharge  
- degraded illumination  
- dormancy events

Mars Raccoon cannot behave like a high-power robot.
It cannot assume “we’ll just run again tomorrow.”

Operations are opportunistic, not guaranteed.

---

### **C4 — Autonomy Will Be Boring**

Mars Raccoon autonomy must be:

- deterministic  
- predictable  
- explainable on a NASA board slide  

Mars Raccoon:
- will not use experimental aggressive AI autonomy
- will not rely on constant human supervision
- will not assume perfect sensing
- will not attempt “clever improvisation”

If uncertain → stop, secure, wait.

---

### **C5 — Vault Supremacy Overrides Everything**

If anything conflicts with vault protection:

- mobility loses  
- retrieval loses  
- autonomy loses  
- operations lose  

Vault protection is the top priority constraint.

---

## 5. Environmental Limits

Mars is hostile. Mars Raccoon must accept these realities.

---

### **E1 — Dust Will Win Sometimes**

Mars Raccoon must accept:
- dust accumulation
- reduced efficiency
- compromised mechanics over time

System must not require:
- clean operating conditions
- perfect surfaces
- periodic human maintenance

---

### **E2 — Thermal Extremes Limit Ambition**

Thermal reality means:
- components age
- endurance behaviors matter
- hardware must remain simple and predictable

Active thermal management is not a primary assumption.

---

### **E3 — Comms Are Unreliable**

Mars Raccoon must not require:
- constant uplink
- real-time supervision
- continuous telemetry

Silence must be survivable.

---

## 6. Architectural Limits

To maintain discipline:

---

### **A1 — No Dependency on Continuous Power**

Vault and primary safety behaviors must not depend on:
- powered retention
- constant thermal stabilization
- active safety elements

Power loss must never equal safety loss.

---

### **A2 — No Cascading Dependencies**

One subsystem failure must not collapse the system.

Mobility failure ≠ mission failure  
Comms failure ≠ vault risk  
Power failure ≠ tube loss

Failure must remain local.

---

### **A3 — Integration Must Stay Understandable**

If the control logic becomes:
- opaque
- fragile
- difficult to reason about
- “trust us” complexity

→ That violates constraints.

---

## 7. Operational Limits

These shape how Mars Raccoon should be used.

---

### **O1 — It Is Not a First-Responder System**

Mars Raccoon is not:
- urgent
- reactive
- time-critical

It is slow logistics support.

---

### **O2 — It Will Sometimes Be Idle for Long Periods**

This is not failure.
This is normal intended behavior.

---

### **O3 — It Must Not Consume Mission Focus**

Mars Raccoon should never become:
- the drama element of Mars Sample Return
- the risk center
- the fragile dependency

It must remain strategically boring.

---

## 8. Political & Programmatic Limits

Mars Raccoon must remain:

- bureaucratically non-threatening  
- architecturally supportive  
- easy to say “yes” to  
- hard to argue against  

If it threatens core mission prestige or control politics,
it becomes harder to adopt — therefore this system must remain humble by design.

---

## 9. Constraint Enforcement Doctrine

Constraints do nothing unless enforced.

If licensed for execution (Phase 3), constraint enforcement would require:

- design reviews explicitly checking constraints
- rejection of “cool but fragile” ideas
- risk + discipline oversight
- continued refusal to become a “hero robot”

Failing constraints = failure of program discipline.

---

## 10. Honest “No-Go” Boundary Conditions

If reality makes any of the following true, Mars Raccoon should pause or die:

- vault cannot be made reliably safe
- retrieval consistently threatens samples
- solar endurance cannot sustain realistic mission duty
- behavior becomes unpredictable or politically threatening
- the system drifts into fragile robotics experimentation

A system that cannot stay within its constraints does not deserve to proceed.

---

## 11. Status

Constraints: **defined**  
Limits: **acknowledged**  
Discipline: **preserved**
