# Phase 1 — Success Criteria

## 1. Purpose of This Document

Phase 1 is not about optimism.
Phase 1 is about truth.

This document defines what “successful Phase 1 completion” actually means in practical, engineering, risk, and mission terms — so we cannot cheat later.

If Phase 1 succeeds honestly, Mars Raccoon is a **real candidate for Phase 2 prototyping and execution framing**.

If Phase 1 fails honestly, Mars Raccoon should be **stopped or redesigned** without ego.

---

## 2. Phase 1 Success Philosophy

Phase 1 is considered successful only if:

- assumptions are tested, not assumed
- weaknesses are exposed, not hidden
- risks are acknowledged, not minimized
- constraints are respected, not hand-waved
- documentation stays grounded, not promotional

Success = **clarity**
Not hope.

---

## 3. Domain Success Requirements

For Phase 1 to be considered successful, all six core assumption domains must pass with credible validation:

---

### 3.1 Retrieval Success Requirements

Retrieval must be shown to be realistically:

- mechanically robust
- dust tolerant
- tolerant to misalignment
- safe for tubes
- capable without fragile precision robotics

**Pass IF:**
- a feasible retrieval architecture category clearly works
- damage risk to tubes is low and manageable
- realistic testing supports confidence

**Fail IF:**
- retrieval requires delicate robotic precision
- or risk of tube damage is credible and frequent

---

### 3.2 Mobility & Navigation Success Requirements

Mobility must be:

- slow
- conservative
- stable
- boring
- power-manageable

Navigation must be:

- supervised
- predictable
- not autonomy-fragile

**Pass IF:**
- defined terrain envelopes are realistic
- entrapment risk is controllable
- navigation does not demand cutting-edge autonomy
- power cost of traversal is acceptable

**Fail IF:**
- movement requires heroics or razor-thin operational margins
- or navigation becomes a science experiment

---

### 3.3 Storage Vault Success Requirements

Vault must:

- reliably retain tubes
- protect against shock & vibration
- prevent abrasion
- fail conservatively
- remain safe over long durations

**Pass IF:**
- storage architecture demonstrates realistic durability
- dust and shock are survivable
- failure modes still protect tubes

**Fail IF:**
- vault failure = tube loss
- or tubes face credible mechanical danger in normal use

---

### 3.4 Power & Uptime Success Requirements

Power story must be believable in real Mars conditions.

Power system must:

- support long idle life
- support occasional movement
- survive dust, winter, and age reasonably
- maintain safe failure behavior

**Pass IF:**
- credible baseline energy architecture emerges
- idle draw is realistically sustainable
- operations fit into real recharge cycles
- safe failure power logic holds up

**Fail IF:**
- system relies on unrealistic optimism
- or nearly collapses under expected Mars variability

---

### 3.5 Failure Behavior Success Requirements

Mars Raccoon must fail:

- predictably
- safely
- recoverably

Failure testing must show that:

- when things go wrong, risk decreases, not increases
- tubes remain safe even in stacked failures
- “stop → secure → protect → wait” is realistically achievable

**Pass IF:**
- failure logic holds up under mobility + retrieval + power + comms stress testing

**Fail IF:**
- failures meaningfully threaten stored tubes
- or introduce unpredictable platform behavior

---

### 3.6 Operational / Integration Realism Success Requirements

Mars Raccoon must:

- integrate into MSR operations cleanly
- function within NASA cadence and procedural reality
- not create unbearable operations burdens
- remain bureaucratically safe to fly

**Pass IF:**
- supervisory operation model remains comfortable
- comms and control cadence is realistic
- value added is clear and defensible

**Fail IF:**
- operations complexity becomes its own risk
- or practical integration becomes politically dubious

---

## 4. Documentation & Honesty Requirements

Phase 1 is only successful if documentation:

- clearly states what works
- clearly states what does NOT work
- includes realistic constraint bounds
- does not hide known limitations
- preserves kill criteria integrity

If Phase 1 becomes marketing material, it automatically fails.

---

## 5. Phase 1 Outcome Categories

Phase 1 does **not** end with “Pass or Fail.”
It recognizes reality comes in shades.

One of the following must be declared:

---

### Outcome A — **Proceed Confidently**
All core domains validate cleanly.
Mars Raccoon is viable with reasonable engineering effort.

Phase 2 recommended.

---

### Outcome B — **Proceed With Constraints**
Most assumptions validated, but:

- capability envelope needs narrowing
- or requirements must be constrained
- or operational expectations must shift

Mars Raccoon continues, but tighter and more realistic.

---

### Outcome C — **Redesign Required**
One or more core domains fail fundamentally,
but concept is still redeemable with meaningful architectural change.

Pause, redesign, re-test.

---

### Outcome D — **Kill Honestly**
Concept fundamentally fails feasibility, safety, or mission logic.

Stopping is success — because it prevents wasted time and false promises.

---

## 6. Phase 1 Completion Statement Definition

Phase 1 can be declared complete only when:

- retrieval feasibility conclusion reached
- mobility feasibility conclusion reached
- storage vault feasibility conclusion reached
- power viability conclusion reached
- failure behavior feasibility conclusion reached
- integration/operations realism conclusion reached
- outcome category declared honestly

Only then does Mars Raccoon have a legitimate path forward.

---

## 7. Phase 1 Success Statement Template

Upon completion, Phase 1 final report should be able to say:

> “Mars Raccoon has been evaluated across retrieval, mobility, storage, power, failure behavior, and operational integration.  
> The assumptions behind the system are [validated / constrained / partially validated / disproven].  
> Based on Phase 1 results, Mars Raccoon should [advance to Phase 2 / advance with constraints / redesign / stop].”

If that sentence cannot be spoken with honesty,
Phase 1 is not complete.

---

## 8. Status
Framework established.

Phase 1 planning structure is now complete.
Execution work would now focus on actually performing these studies and documenting results truthfully.
