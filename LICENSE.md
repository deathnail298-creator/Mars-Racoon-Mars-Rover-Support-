# Mars Raccoon License — Open Until Commercialized

This work is intentionally open for early-stage exploration,
discussion, academic analysis, simulation, and preliminary engineering.

You may:
- Study it  
- Reference it  
- Analyze it  
- Build conceptual models  
- Perform Phase-0 and Phase-1 style feasibility and assumption work  

This permission is granted so ideas can spread, improve, and mature.

## 🚨 Commercialization Boundary

If you:

- build hardware  
- prototype beyond hobby / academic exploration  
- integrate into funded programs  
- incorporate into contract work  
- include in SBIR / STTR execution  
- advance toward operational deployment  
- or otherwise begin turning this into a real product, service, or mission capability  

👉 **You must contact the authors and obtain a commercial license.**

No exceptions.
No quiet commercialization.
No “we just slightly changed it.”
No “but we’re testing internally.”

If money, contracts, funded development, or field execution begin,
this license no longer grants permission.

## Commercial Licensing Intent

- not to block progress  
- not to gatekeep

It exists to:

- support sustainable innovation  
- ensure derivative systems respect origin work  

We support responsible use.
We do not support silent appropriation.
