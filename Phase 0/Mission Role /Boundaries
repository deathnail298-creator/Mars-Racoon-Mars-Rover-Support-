### Tube Custody & Handoff Reality

Mars Raccoon is not a full logistics chain. It is a **buffer layer** in the MSR architecture.

It does:
- retrieve tubes
- secure them in a protected vault
- concentrate them into an accessible location

It does NOT:
- return tubes to orbit
- perform capsule integration
- replace SRL role
- require NASA to redesign MSR

Handoff expectation:
- tubes are later collected by whatever primary retrieval infrastructure survives
- this reduces geographic spread and recovery uncertainty
- it trades “lost forever” risk for “delayed but recoverable”

Mars Raccoon is not ownership of sample logistics. It is insurance and consolidation.
