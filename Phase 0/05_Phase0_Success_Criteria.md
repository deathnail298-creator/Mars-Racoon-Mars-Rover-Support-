# Phase 0 — Success Criteria

## 1. Purpose of This Document

Phase 0 is not about proving Mars Raccoon works.
Phase 0 is about proving Mars Raccoon **deserves to exist** as a legitimate mission concept.

This document defines the criteria that must be satisfied to confidently say:

> “Mars Raccoon is justified, coherent, and worth advancing to Phase 1 testing and engineering.”

---

## 2. Phase 0 Mindset

Phase 0 must demonstrate:

- clear purpose
- grounded realism
- disciplined scope
- credible integration posture
- sane failure philosophy
- bureaucratic survivability

If Phase 0 succeeds, Mars Raccoon moves forward as a **real candidate solution**, not a thought experiment.

---

## 3. Success Domain 1 — Role Clarity

Mars Raccoon must have a **single, non-confusing mission identity**.

Phase 0 is successful if:

- Its job is unambiguously defined as:
  > retrieve tubes → protect tubes → wait
- It is clearly identified as a logistics support platform
- It is explicitly **not** positioned as:
  - a science rover
  - a primary MSR platform
  - a helicopter replacement
  - a multi-role robot
- Stakeholders can describe the mission in one or two sentences

**Verification:**  
Documentation communicates a stable, consistent role without contradiction.

**Status:** Achieved.

---

## 4. Success Domain 2 — Risk Reduction Logic

Mars Raccoon must **reduce real mission risk** in a defensible way.

Phase 0 succeeds if it is clear that:

- Mars Raccoon materially lowers risk of losing sample tubes
- It provides meaningful **redundancy**
- It turns scattered tubes into a consolidated, protected asset
- Even in partial success scenarios, it improves outcomes
- It never makes risk worse through aggressive or fragile behavior

**Verification:**  
Risk doctrine and failure philosophy demonstrate risk reduction rather than risk trade-off.

**Status:** Achieved.

---

## 5. Success Domain 3 — Technical Plausibility

Mars Raccoon must be believable as an engineering project, not fantasy hardware.

Phase 0 succeeds if:

- It relies primarily on conservative, known technologies
- It uses survivable slow mobility, not acrobatics
- Retrieval philosophy is robust, not delicate or magical
- Internal storage protection is mechanically reasonable
- Power/use cycle assumptions match realistic Mars operations
- Behavior prioritizes determinism over autonomous brilliance

**Verification:**  
Design philosophy describes credible, implementable approaches consistent with Mars realities.

**Status:** Achieved.

---

## 6. Success Domain 4 — Integration Compatibility with MSR

Mars Raccoon must plug into MSR without forcing architectural chaos.

Phase 0 succeeds if:

- It fits naturally into MSR mission flow
- It relies only on capabilities MSR already plans to have:
  - tubes exist
  - tube locations are known
  - communications and command cadence exist
- It supports rather than competes with:
  - rover-based retrieval concepts
  - helicopter retrieval concepts
  - any future retrieval method
- It creates **no hard dependencies**
- It clearly benefits downstream retrieval systems

**Verification:**  
Integration context demonstrates clean coexistence and architectural harmony.

**Status:** Achieved.

---

## 7. Success Domain 5 — Failure Discipline

Mars Raccoon must fail in ways that remain recoverable and non-catastrophic.

Phase 0 succeeds if:

- Mobility failure = stuck but stable, tubes still safe
- Retrieval failure = does not damage tubes
- System failure = defaults to safe idle protection
- Storage vault = emphasizes tube preservation even if platform dies
- Failure never escalates mission risk beyond baseline

**Verification:**  
Failure doctrine explicitly prioritizes predictable safe failure behavior.

**Status:** Achieved.

---

## 8. Success Domain 6 — Cost Class and Practical Value

Mars Raccoon must make sense in real budget and political space.

Phase 0 succeeds if:

- It clearly lives in a lower cost class than:
  - backup rover concepts (billion-class)
  - helicopter retrieval (hundreds-of-millions)
- It is conceptually deployable as a **fleet**, not a singleton
- It provides extremely high value for cost
- It strengthens mission assurance narratives and review credibility

**Verification:**  
Executive framing and positioning logic demonstrate meaningful economic advantage.

**Status:** Achieved.

---

## 9. Success Domain 7 — Bureaucratic & Political Safety

Mars Raccoon must be **easy to approve and hard to attack**.

Phase 0 succeeds if:

- It does not threaten flagship programs
- It does not demand architectural restructuring
- It supports “hero systems” rather than competing with them
- It strengthens, rather than weakens, NASA’s political position
- It is bureaucratically non-threatening but strategically powerful

**Verification:**  
Documentation clearly positions Mars Raccoon as a supportive infrastructure asset.

**Status:** Achieved.

---

## 10. Phase 0 Completion Statement

Mars Raccoon passes Phase 0 because:

- It has a disciplined identity
- It reduces real and politically relevant risk
- It is technically plausible
- It integrates cleanly into MSR
- It fails safely
- It exists in a favorable cost class
- It is politically safe and operationally valuable

**Conclusion:**
> Mars Raccoon earns **Permission to Exist** and is justified to advance into **Phase 1 — Assumption Testing and Engineering Exploration.**
